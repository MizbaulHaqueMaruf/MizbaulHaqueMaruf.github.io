            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm Maruf, a sophomore Software Engineering student at IUT
              with a strong programming foundation. Passionate about
              problem-solving in C++ and web development using the MERN stack. I
              strive to create innovative solutions and excel in software
              development. Alongside software engineering, I have a keen
              interest in Machine Learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey began with C++, where I developed skills in logical
              thinking and algorithmic design. I enjoy breaking down complex
              problems and creating efficient solutions. In addition to C++, I
              am well-versed in web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB,
              Express.js, React, and Node.js). Currently, I am studying various
              ML algorithms and frameworks.
